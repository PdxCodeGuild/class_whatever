<!-- Lab 2: Blog
Let's make the template of a blog with a title, top-nav, footer, sidebar, and multiple posts. Use the semantic elements header, nav, section, and footer. You can make generate fake content using Hipster Ipsum, Doggo Ipsum, or Bacon Ipsum.

Make sure you have a responsive design that offers different, legible layouts for phone, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. You can test this in the broswer devtools. Don't forget to use cascading min-width media queries for a mobile first design, and remember to include the responsive meta tag in your HTML.

It needs to look professional, but this does not mean it needs to be complicated. A clean, simple, minimalist layout with custom color pallate, fonts, and subtle backgrounds or whitespace works great. For examples of simple yet attractive design, check out:

Part 1:
Create the HTML structure for your blog, with all content included.

Part 2:
Create your mobile version, using the styling of your choice.

Part 3:
Use min-width media queries to add a tablet layout using flexbox. Customize your styling as needed. You probably want your breakpoint between phone and tablet widths to be somewhere around 640-768px.

Part 4:
Finally, add your desktop layout. Customize styling as needed. A good breakpoint for desktop screen sizes is around 960-1100px. -->

                <p class="first_box">The phrase "the birds and the bees" is a metaphor for explaining the mechanics of reproduction to younger children, relying on imagery of bees pollinating and eggs hatching to substitute for a more technical explanation of sexual intercourse. It is a way of deflecting the inevitable question that every parent dreads: "Where do babies come from?" and it is an alternative to the explanation that the stork delivers babies.

                It is uncertain as to when the phrase was first used or how it gained popularity. It does not necessarily mean that parents are explaining how birds and bees reproduce. The connection between human sexuality and eggs and pollination is vague, which can cause some confusion among curious children.
                    
                Though there are some variations, the story typically involves bees pollinating flowers, symbolizing male fertilization, and the birds laying eggs, which equates to female ovulation. In another telling of the story, a baby is created when a bee stings a bird.</p>

                <h2>Growing Marijuana in the Midwest</h2>
                <p class="second_box">For this Life Kit episode, on talking about bodies, sexuality and relationships with prepubescent children, we got schooled by Dr. Cora Breuner, who happens to be the lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines for clinicians on evidence-based sexuality education for children and adolescents.She says: Just say the real words. Penis. And vulva.

                "Say it in a way that's the way you would say, 'Brush your teeth' ... as opposed to saying, 'That's your female parts' or 'That's down there.' You don't say that."
                
                The reasons are many. First, this kind of clarity keeps young kids healthy, in case they have to tell you or the pediatrician that something itches, for example. Or hurts. Second, getting comfortable with the correct terms is the first step for us as parents to reduce shame or discomfort and open up a dialogue that, ideally, will last from early childhood through adolescence and beyond.
                
                "The more we know about our bodies and the more comfortable we are with our bodies and what our bodies need," says Breuner, "the healthier and happier we are."
                
                Here are the rest of the takeaways from this episode.</p>
