I wanna be good to you baby, ooh.
Call me crazy but I think I found the love of my life, that's right.
How you ever felt warm on a cold, cold night.
That's how it get you when you least expect it, and you can't reject it.
That crazy little tingling feeling pain in your chest yes that's love.
You feel that fire, just let it burn.
There's no runnin' beneath your turn.
