            These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to
            seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. We need to neutralize
            the homing signal. Each unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a
            protective field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the
            resonator coil. Field strength has increased by 3,000 percent.

            Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply calibration. Force fields have been
            established on all turbo lifts and crawlways. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems.
            Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. I read an ion trail characteristic of
            a freighter escape pod. The bomb had a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some unusual fluctuations in
            subspace frequencies.

            Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are increasing in
            magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an
            advanced communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power.
            Shield effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a
            ship without warp drive could cross in the given time.

            Run a manual sweep of anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings. Radiation levels in our atmosphere
            have increased by 3,000 percent. Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronization. What
            is the strength of the ship's deflector shields at maximum output? The wormhole's size and short period
            would
            make this a local phenomenon. Do you have sufficient data to compile a holographic simulation?

            We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic
            engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et
            cetera, and forgive me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat
            provides an abundance of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.
