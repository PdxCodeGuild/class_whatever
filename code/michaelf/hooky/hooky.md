# Hooky

###### A place to learn from home. 


**Project Overview**

Institutions of learning often lag behind social media and entertainment when it comes to integrating new technology into the way they function, and understandably so. Places of education tend to rely on consistency, and the ever-changing and complicated nature of technological development not only intimidates educators but also makes proves very hard for a school or university to implement and update a reliable system. With the covid pandemic currently grounding billions of students worldwide, student doubt mounting, and the reality setting in for many institutions, instructors, and newly homeschooling parents that our education system was not prepared for what transpired, an opportunity lies to redefine the way we think about the way that we learn. Hooky is a simple, accessible, web-based virtual classroom that I hope can be a baby step towards leading us in the right direction. 

**Major Features**

###### Virtual Classroom

**As an instructor**, I want video chat capabilities, so that I can see my students and communicate with them as if we were face to face.

Tasks:



**As an instructor**, I also want a search engine within the classroom that allows my students to look up content relevant to our lectures. 

**As an instructor**, I also want a text messaging system within the system so that I can easily share information with my students, and a file upload portal so that students can submit their homework in a clear and itemized fashion. 

###### Homepage + Curated Content

**As a student**, I want a simple to navigate searchable database of courses offered on hooky, as well as an account page to keep track of classrooms I am enrolled in.
