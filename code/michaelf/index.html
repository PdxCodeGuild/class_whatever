        <h3> John Snow</h3>
        <p>John Snow is an english doctor who is now dead. While alive, he contributed to the development of anaesthesia. He also famously traced the source of a cholera outbreak in London in 1854 back to a public well, succesfully slowing the spread of the disease. He is widely considered to be the father of modern epidemiology. <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow">John Snow Wiki</a></p>

        <p>Before John Snow died at the ripe age of 45, he was alive in the following places:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>York, England</li>
            <li>Newcasle, England</li>
            <li>Killingworth, England</li>
            <li>Newcasle, England</li>
            <li>Burnopfield, England</li>
            <li>Pateley Bridge, England</li>
            <li>London, England</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Basically, he lived in England for the entirety of his very short life.</p>
        <blockquote><em>On proceeding to the spot, I found that nearly all the deaths had taken place within a short distance of the [Broad Street] pump. There were only ten deaths in houses situated decidedly nearer to another street-pump. In five of these cases the families of the deceased persons informed me that they always sent to the pump in Broad Street, as they preferred the water to that of the pumps which were nearer. In three other cases, the deceased were children who went to school near the pump in Broad Street...

            With regard to the deaths occurring in the locality belonging to the pump, there were 61 instances in which I was informed that the deceased persons used to drink the pump water from Broad Street, either constantly or occasionally...
            
            The result of the inquiry, then, is, that there has been no particular outbreak or prevalence of cholera in this part of London except among the persons who were in the habit of drinking the water of the above-mentioned pump well.
            
            I had an interview with the Board of Guardians of St James's parish, on the evening of the 7th inst [7 September], and represented the above circumstances to them. In consequence of what I said, the handle of the pump was removed on the following day.</em></br><p></p><small>-John Snow, letter to the editor of the Medical Times and Gazette</small> </blockquote>
