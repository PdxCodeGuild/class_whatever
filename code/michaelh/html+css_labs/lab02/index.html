# Lab 2: Blog
Let's make the template of a blog with a title, top-nav, footer, sidebar, and multiple posts. Use the [semantic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) header, nav, section, and footer. You can make generate fake content using [Hipster Ipsum](https://hipsum.co/), [Doggo Ipsum](https://doggoipsum.com/), or [Bacon Ipsum](https://baconipsum.com/). 
Make sure you have a [responsive design](../docs/09%20-%20CSS%20Responsive%20Design.md) that offers different, legible layouts for phone, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. You can test this in the broswer devtools. Don't forget to use cascading min-width media queries for a mobile first design, and remember to include the responsive meta tag in your HTML.
It needs to look professional, but this does not mean it needs to be complicated. A clean, simple, minimalist layout with custom color pallate, fonts, and subtle backgrounds or whitespace works great. For examples of simple yet attractive design, check out:

## Part 1:
Create the HTML structure for your blog, with all content included.

## Part 2:
Create your mobile version, using the styling of your choice.

## Part 3:
Use ```min-width``` media queries to add a tablet layout using flexbox. Customize your styling as needed. You probably want your breakpoint between phone and tablet widths to be somewhere around 640-768px.

## Part 4:
Finally, add your desktop layout. Customize styling as needed. A good breakpoint for desktop screen sizes is around 960-1100px. -->

                <h3>Change for a Dollar</h3>
                <h4>16 SEP 2019</h4>
                <p>Change for a Dollar is a short film by Sharon Wright. The short movie follows a seemingly homeless man wander through the course of a day, in which he gives away the dollar in change that was dumped into his tin can. Following the course of how the "dollar" was used, the viewer essentially gets an eye-opening opportunity to watch lives changed, based on the premise that it doesn't take much to make a difference. The film was filmed in a single day in Osawatomie, Kansas on March 13, 2010 with the assistance of several Kansas City, Missouri film makers, and a small cast. To date the video as posted on YouTube has had more than 2,200,000 views where it is stated to be "One of the MOST VIEWED films in schools nationwide". The film has won several awards including two regional Emmy awards, and two Telly Awards in 2012, and several others. Famous film critic Roger Ebert commented in his December 7, 2011 newsletter that "It touched me. Sharon Wright. Remember that name."</p>
