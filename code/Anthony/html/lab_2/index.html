                    The Small UAV class (which also called sometimes mini-UAV) applies to UAVs that have at least one dimension greater than 50 cm and no larger than 2 meters. Many of the designs in this category are based on the fixed-wing model, and most are hand-launched by throwing them in the air as shown in Figure 1.2. Examples of members of this small UAV class are:

                <h3>Group 2:Medium UAVs</h3>

                <p>
                    The medium UAV class applies to UAVs that are too heavy to be carried by one person but are still smaller than a light aircraft. They usually have a wingspan of about 5-10 m and can carry payloads of 100 to 200 kg. Examples of medium fixed-wing UAVs are (see Figure 1.6, below) the Israeli-US Hunter and the UK Watchkeeper. There are other brands used in the past, such as the US Boeing Eagle Eye, the RQ-2 Pioneer, the BAE systems Skyeye R4E, and the RQ-5A Hunter. The Hunter has a wingspan of 10.2 m and is 6.9 m long. It weighs about 885 kg at takeoff. The RS-20 by American Aerospace is another example of a crossover UAV that spans the specifications of a small and medium sized UAV. Many other medium UAVs can be found in the reading assignment. There are also numbers of rotary-based medium sized UAVs.

                <p>
                    The large UAV class applies to the large UAVs used mainly for combat operations by the military. Examples of these large UAVs are the US General Atomics Predator A and B and the US Northrop Grumman Global Hawk

                    These Groups of UAVs usually have a normal operating altitude less than 18,000 feet MSL
