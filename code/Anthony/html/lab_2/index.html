                <h3>Group 1: Small/Very Small UAVs</h3>
                <h5>Very Small UAVs</h5>
                <img src="https://www.airforce-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/09/1-Image-1-31.jpg" alt="mini-UAV">
                <p>
                    The very small UAV class applies to UAVs with dimensions ranging from the size of a large insect to 30-50 cm long. The insect-like UAVs, with flapping or rotary wings, are a popular micro design. They are extremely small in size, are very light weight, and can be used for spying and biological warfare. Larger ones utilize conventional aircraft configuration. The choice between flapping or rotary wings is a matter of desired maneuverability. Flapping wing-based designs allow perching and landing on small surfaces. Examples of very small UAVs are the Israeli IAI Malat Mosquito (with wing span of 35 cm and endurance of 40 minutes,) the US Aurora Flight Sciences Skate (with wing span of 60 cm and length of 33 cm), the Australian Cyber Technology CyberQuad Mini (with 42x42 cm square), and their latest model, CyberQuad Maxi.

                <p>
                    The Small UAV class (which also called sometimes mini-UAV) applies to UAVs that have at least one dimension greater than 50 cm and no larger than 2 meters. Many of the designs in this category are based on the fixed-wing model, and most are hand-launched by throwing them in the air as shown in Figure 1.2. Examples of members of this small UAV class are:

                <h3>Group 2:Medium UAVs</h3>

                <p>
                    The medium UAV class applies to UAVs that are too heavy to be carried by one person but are still smaller than a light aircraft. They usually have a wingspan of about 5-10 m and can carry payloads of 100 to 200 kg. Examples of medium fixed-wing UAVs are (see Figure 1.6, below) the Israeli-US Hunter and the UK Watchkeeper. There are other brands used in the past, such as the US Boeing Eagle Eye, the RQ-2 Pioneer, the BAE systems Skyeye R4E, and the RQ-5A Hunter. The Hunter has a wingspan of 10.2 m and is 6.9 m long. It weighs about 885 kg at takeoff. The RS-20 by American Aerospace is another example of a crossover UAV that spans the specifications of a small and medium sized UAV. Many other medium UAVs can be found in the reading assignment. There are also numbers of rotary-based medium sized UAVs.

                <p>
                    The large UAV class applies to the large UAVs used mainly for combat operations by the military. Examples of these large UAVs are the US General Atomics Predator A and B and the US Northrop Grumman Global Hawk
